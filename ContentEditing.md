# Content Editing

In order to create an **article** the user must head to the CMS's URL, which is http://platform.od4d.org/casein.

The CMS has two sections:

- Seções
- Posts

#### Seções

These are the article sections to be used on the posts. They may have both a Name and a Description.

#### Posts

These are the Articles themselves. They need to have a section in order to be listed beneath it on the website and may also have several comma separated values on the **about** field.
